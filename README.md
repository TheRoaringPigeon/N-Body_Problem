# N-Body_Problem
Simulating gravitational attraction for x number of bodies
The general idea is to try and simulate and predict how multiple celestial objects would interact with each other if they were in orbit 
and therefore interacting gravitationally. 

This is not exact, as the physics problem is still unsolved. I've used Fg = G * ((m1 * m2) / |r|squared) * direction vector.
I'm not taking any other forces into account.
